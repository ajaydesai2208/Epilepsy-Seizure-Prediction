# Epilepsy-Seizure-Prediction
Abstract

Epileptic seizures occur due to disorders in brain functionality which can affect a
patient's health. Prediction of epileptic seizures before the beginning of the onset is
quite useful for preventing the seizure by medication. Deep Learning techniques and
computational methods are used for predicting epileptic seizures from
Electroencephalograms (EEG) signals. However, preprocessing of EEG signals for
noise removal and features extraction are two major issues that have an adverse effect
on both anticipation time and true positive prediction rate. Therefore, we propose a
model that provides reliable methods of both preprocessing and feature extraction.
Our model predicts epileptic seizuresâ€™ sufficient time before the onset of seizure
starts and provides a better true positive rate. We have applied empirical mode
decomposition (EMD) for preprocessing and have extracted time and frequency
domain features for training a prediction model. The proposed model detects the start
of the preictal state, which is the state that starts a few minutes before the onset of the
seizure, with a higher true positive rate as compared to traditional methods.
